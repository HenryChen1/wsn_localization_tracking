# Localization and Tracking in Wireless Sensors Network

This is my graduation project in Computer Engineering and Automation I use machine learning algorithms (Support Victor Machine and Random Fourier Features) with Kalman Filter for tracking in Wireless Sensors Network.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This a python scripts need the following libraries to run them:
- scipy
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Functionality
you will see multiple scripts and files and I will interduce you to them:
First:
[Lib]() This is Folder containes my programming implementation for Kalman Filter in the Three orders
[model]() This contains script Model.py I used for Tunning the paramater of My SVM regressor and saving it also include a Lib folder
[Random Fourier Features]() This folder also for testing techinique I used to know about the best parameters for RFF
[Results]() This contains some importatnt images I saved for the project
[trajectory]() This script used for building the trajectories for my study
[WSN]() This scrpit very important for building the WSN rssi , Training point and Locating the sensors and I used as a function to be used in other places
[main.py]() contains my study in the network and testing the perfomance and accurency for algorithms I used and shows how could be very useful.
All my results are plotted from this script.you 
[READ-ME.md]() This the file you are reading :3
